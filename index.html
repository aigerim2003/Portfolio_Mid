        <h2>AIGERIM NAIZABEKOVA</h2>
        <p> I am Aigerim. And my last name is Naizabekova.
             I come from the village of Belovodsk, Moscow district and was born there too.
               Since 2007 , I have been living in Bishkek with my family .
               <br>
               At school, my passion for mathematics set me apart from my classmates.
                Math became my favorite subject and I was constantly looking for new ways to solve math problems.
                This passion for logic and analysis inspired me to explore programming.
                <br>
                That's why I decided to major in programming at university. 
                The world of code and algorithms provides me with endless opportunities for creativity and solving complex problems. 
                I am committed to developing my skills in this area and creating programs that can improve people's lives.
                <br>My combination of interests in art and technology allows me to see programming as an art in creating innovation.
                I'm looking forward to contributing to technology and making the world a better place through code.
